### Yelp In React 

this project will simulate the yelp app by React.js. 

In this project, I will use 'http-proxy-middleware' package to provide the proxy. the backend data stored in 'api/' 
directory. and create the additional setup file named 'setupProxy.js'. to get the backend data I need to install 
'serve' on global and run `serve -l 4999` to start up the server.
